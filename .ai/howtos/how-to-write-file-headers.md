# How to: Write File Headers

**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide for writing compliant file headers for all file types

**Scope**: All code, configuration, and documentation files in any project

**Overview**: This practical guide walks through the process of writing effective file headers for markdown,
    Python, TypeScript, YAML, and other file types. Covers the atemporal documentation principle, mandatory
    fields, file-type specific formatting, template usage, and common mistakes. Provides concrete examples
    and a verification checklist to ensure headers meet standards. Suitable for beginners learning documentation
    standards and experienced developers looking for a quick reference.

**Dependencies**: File header standards (.ai/docs/file-headers.md), templates (.ai/templates/file-header-*.template)

**Exports**: Practical file header creation process, examples, and verification checklist

**Related**: FILE_HEADER_STANDARDS.md, file header templates

**Implementation**: Step-by-step process with examples and checklists for each file type

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- [ ] Access to file header templates (`.ai/templates/file-header-*.template`)
- [ ] Understanding of the file type you're documenting
- [ ] Basic knowledge of the file's purpose in the project

**Estimated Time**: 15-20 minutes per file

**Difficulty**: Beginner

## Step 1: Choose the Right Template

Select the appropriate template based on file type:

| File Type | Template | Comment Style |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Markdown (.md) | `file-header-markdown.template` | `**Field**:` format |
| Python (.py) | `file-header-python.template` | `"""` docstring |
| TypeScript/JavaScript (.ts, .tsx, .js, .jsx) | `file-header-typescript.template` | `/** */` JSDoc |
| YAML (.yml, .yaml) | `file-header-yaml.template` | `# Field:` comment |
| JSON (.json) | Special format | `_header` object or adjacent doc |
| Terraform (.tf, .hcl) | Adapt YAML template | `# Field:` comment |
| Docker (Dockerfile, compose) | Adapt YAML template | `# Field:` comment |
| HTML (.html) | Special format | `<!-- -->` comment |
| CSS (.css, .scss) | Special format | `/* */` comment |
| Shell (.sh, .ps1, .bat) | Adapt YAML template | `# Field:` comment |

**Action**: Open the appropriate template:
```bash
cat .ai/templates/file-header-python.template
```

## Step 2: Understand Mandatory Fields

Every file header must include these three fields:

### Purpose
**What**: Brief description of file's functionality (1-2 lines)
**Why**: Tells readers immediately what this file does
**Example**: "Validates user input according to business rules and security requirements"

### Scope
**What**: What areas/components this file covers
**Why**: Defines boundaries and applicability
**Example**: "User registration and authentication flows across all API endpoints"

### Overview
**What**: Comprehensive summary (3-5+ lines)
**Why**: Provides detailed understanding without reading code
**Example**:
```
This module handles all user authentication including password validation,
token generation, session management, and OAuth2 integration. Implements
JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens, rate limiting, and brute-force
protection. Integrates with the user service for account verification and
supports multiple authentication providers (local, Google, GitHub).
```

## Step 3: Apply the Atemporal Principle

**Key Rule**: Never reference time, dates, or changes.

### What to Avoid

❌ **Temporal Language**:
- "Currently supports..."
- "Recently added..."
- "Will implement..."
- "Changed from X to Y"
- "Created: 2025-09-12"
- "Now includes..."
- "Temporarily disabled"

### What to Use Instead

✅ **Present-Tense Descriptions**:
- "Supports..."
- "Provides..."
- "Implements..."
- "Handles..."
- "Manages..."
- "Validates..."

### Examples

**Bad**:
```
Purpose: Recently updated to handle user authentication. Currently supports JWT tokens.
```

**Good**:
```
Purpose: Handles user authentication using JWT tokens
```

**Bad**:
```
Overview: This was changed from using session cookies to JWT tokens. Will add OAuth2 support later.
```

**Good**:
```
Overview: Implements JWT token-based authentication with session management.
    Provides token generation, validation, and refresh functionality. Integrates
    with the user service for account verification and authorization.
```

## Step 4: Choose Header Format

### Standard vs AI-Optimized Headers

You have two options for file headers:

**Standard Headers** (this document):
- Human-first, narrative style
- Traditional documentation format
- Good for general-purpose development

**AI-Optimized Headers** (see `docs/ai-doc-standard.md`):
- **Recommended for AI-assisted development workflows**
- Machine-readable metadata optimized for LLMs
- 2-3x more files fit in AI context windows
- Front-loaded critical information (`File:` field first)
- Explicit `Exports:` and `Depends:` fields
- Better semantic search and retrieval

**When to Use AI-Optimized Format**:
- ✅ Team heavily uses AI coding assistants (Claude, Copilot, Cursor)
- ✅ Large codebase (100+ files) needing better AI navigation
- ✅ Microservices architecture with complex dependencies
- ✅ Frequent developer rotation (AI helps onboarding)

**Key Difference**: AI-optimized headers put `File:` field FIRST and use structured metadata before narrative. See `docs/ai-doc-standard.md` for complete specification with examples.

## Step 5: Write the Header (File-Type Specific)

### For Markdown Files

services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: .docker/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.backend
```

## Step 5: Fill in Additional Fields (Code Files)

For code files (Python, TypeScript, etc.), include these additional fields:

### Dependencies
List key dependencies that aren't obvious from imports:
- External libraries
- Internal modules
- System requirements

**Example**:
```
Dependencies: Redis for caching, PostgreSQL for persistence, boto3 for AWS S3 integration
```

### Exports
Document what this file provides to other parts of the system:
- Main classes
- Public functions
- Constants
- Types/interfaces

**Example**:
```
Exports: UserService class, User dataclass, UserNotFoundError exception, get_current_user() helper
```

### Interfaces
Describe key APIs this file exposes:
- Public methods
- API endpoints
- Event handlers

**Example**:
```
Interfaces: authenticate(username, password) -> Token, validate_token(token) -> User, refresh_token(refresh_token) -> Token
```

### Implementation (Optional but Recommended)
Note important technical decisions:
- Algorithms used
- Design patterns
- Architectural choices

**Example**:
```
Implementation: Uses bcrypt for password hashing, JWT with RS256 for tokens, Redis for token blacklisting
```

## Step 6: Format According to File Type

### Markdown
- Double line breaks after each field
- Horizontal rule (`---`) separates header from content
- Use `**Field**:` format

### Python
- Triple quotes (`"""`) for docstring
- Blank lines between field sections
- First thing in file (after shebang if present)

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- JSDoc format (`/** */`)
- Asterisk (`*`) at start of each line
- Blank lines between field sections

### YAML/Configuration
- Hash (`#`) comments
- Single space after `#` and after field colon
- Multi-line continuation with indentation

## Step 7: Verify Your Header

Use this checklist to verify header completeness:

### Mandatory Fields
- [ ] **Purpose** field present (1-2 lines)
- [ ] **Scope** field present and clear
- [ ] **Overview** field present (3-5+ lines minimum)

### Atemporal Language
- [ ] No temporal words ("currently", "now", "recently", "will")
- [ ] No dates or timestamps
- [ ] No state change language ("changed from", "replaced")
- [ ] No future references ("planned", "to be added")

### Content Quality
- [ ] Purpose is specific and clear
- [ ] Scope defines boundaries
- [ ] Overview provides comprehensive understanding
- [ ] Dependencies listed (if applicable)
- [ ] Exports documented (if applicable)

### Formatting
- [ ] Correct comment style for file type
- [ ] Proper line breaks and spacing
- [ ] Consistent indentation
- [ ] Header at top of file (correct position)

## Common Mistakes and Solutions

### Mistake 1: Too Brief Overview

**Problem**:
```python
"""
Purpose: User service
Scope: Users
Overview: Handles users
"""
```

**Solution**:
```python
"""
Purpose: Manages user account operations and authentication

Scope: User registration, authentication, profile management, and account settings

Overview: Provides comprehensive user management including account creation, authentication,
    profile updates, and account deletion. Implements secure password hashing, email verification,
    and session management. Integrates with the database for user persistence and the email
    service for notifications. Handles user permissions and role-based access control.

Dependencies: SQLAlchemy for database, bcrypt for password hashing, email service for notifications

Exports: UserService class, User model, UserNotFoundError exception
"""
```

### Mistake 2: Using Temporal Language

**Problem**:
```python
"""
Purpose: Recently updated authentication module that currently handles login

Overview: This was changed from using sessions to JWT tokens. Will add OAuth2 support soon.
"""
```

**Solution**:
```python
"""
Purpose: Handles user authentication using JWT tokens

Overview: Implements JWT-based authentication with token generation, validation, and refresh
    functionality. Provides login and logout operations with secure password verification.
    Supports token expiration and refresh token rotation for enhanced security.
"""
```

### Mistake 3: Wrong Comment Format

**Problem** (Python file with markdown-style header):
```python
**Purpose**: User service
**Scope**: User management
```

**Solution**:
```python
"""
Purpose: User service managing account operations

Scope: User management including registration, authentication, and profiles
"""
```

### Mistake 4: Missing Mandatory Fields

**Problem**:
```typescript
/**
 * User authentication component
 */
```

**Solution**:
```typescript
/**
 * Purpose: User authentication form component with validation
 *
 * Scope: Login and registration forms across the application
 *
 * Overview: Provides reusable authentication form with real-time validation, error handling,
 *     and accessible design. Handles both login and registration modes with password strength
 *     checking and email validation. Integrates with authentication service for API calls.
 *
 * Dependencies: React, react-hook-form, auth service
 *
 * Exports: AuthForm component, AuthFormProps interface
 */
```

### Mistake 5: Header in Wrong Location

**Problem** (Python - header after imports):
```python
import os
import sys

"""
Purpose: Configuration loader
"""
```

**Solution**:
```python
"""
Purpose: Configuration loader managing application settings

Scope: Application-wide configuration from environment variables and files

Overview: Loads and validates application configuration from multiple sources including
    environment variables, .env files, and default settings. Provides type-safe access
    to configuration values with validation and default fallbacks.
