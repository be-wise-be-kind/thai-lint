# Purpose: Automated security scanning workflow for thai-lint
# Scope: Static analysis, dependency vulnerabilities, secret detection
# Overview: Runs comprehensive security scans on every push/PR and weekly.
#     Includes Bandit (SAST), pip-audit with CVE blocking, and Gitleaks.
#     Critical vulnerabilities block the pipeline unless explicitly ignored.
