## PR1.1: Test Review & Architecture Alignment 🔴 NOT STARTED

**Objective**: Review and update PR1 tests to align with clarified single-pass streaming architecture

**Issue Identified**: PR1 tests were written before architecture clarification. Many tests use `cache_enabled: false` which conflicts with the new design where cache IS the hash table.

**Activities**:
1. Review all 106 tests from PR1 for architectural assumptions
2. Identify tests that assume incorrect behavior
3. Decide on cache_enabled: false implementation (Decision 6: In-Memory Fallback)
4. Update tests to either:
   - Use `cache_enabled: true` (preferred for integration tests)
   - Accept in-memory fallback behavior (for unit tests)
5. Verify test expectations match stateful design:
   - Each file reports its own violations
   - Violations reference other file locations
   - No assumption about processing order

**Key Decision (from AI_CONTEXT.md Decision 6)**:
- When `cache_enabled: false`, use in-memory dict[int, list[CodeBlock]] as fallback
- Same stateful behavior, but no SQLite persistence
- Allows tests to run with isolation while maintaining architecture

**Files to Review/Update**:
- tests/unit/linters/dry/test_python_duplicates.py (15 tests)
- tests/unit/linters/dry/test_typescript_duplicates.py (15 tests)
- tests/unit/linters/dry/test_cross_file_detection.py (11 tests)
- tests/unit/linters/dry/test_within_file_detection.py (10 tests)
- tests/unit/linters/dry/test_cache_operations.py (11 tests) - May need significant updates
- tests/unit/linters/dry/test_config_loading.py (11 tests)
- tests/unit/linters/dry/test_violation_messages.py (8 tests)
- tests/unit/linters/dry/test_ignore_directives.py (9 tests)
- tests/unit/linters/dry/test_cli_interface.py (4 tests)
- tests/unit/linters/dry/test_library_api.py (4 tests)
- tests/unit/linters/dry/test_edge_cases.py (8 tests)

**Completion Criteria**:
- ✅ All tests reviewed for architectural correctness
- ✅ Decision 6 (in-memory fallback) implementation plan documented
- ✅ Tests updated to match stateful design
- ✅ All 106 tests still fail (no implementation yet) with correct expectations
- ✅ Test isolation maintained (each test can run independently)
- ✅ Documentation updated to reflect any test changes

**Estimated Duration**: 2-4 hours

**Date Completed**: TBD

## PR2: Core Implementation + SQLite Cache 🔴 NOT STARTED

**Objective**: Implement DRY analyzer with SQLite caching to pass ~80% of PR1 tests

**Files to Create**:
- src/linters/dry/__init__.py
- src/linters/dry/config.py (DRYConfig dataclass with cache settings)
- src/linters/dry/cache.py (SQLite cache manager WITH query methods)
- src/linters/dry/token_hasher.py (Tokenization + rolling hash)
- src/linters/dry/python_analyzer.py (Python tokenization)
- src/linters/dry/violation_builder.py (Violation messages with locations)
- src/linters/dry/linter.py (STATEFUL DRYRule class - cache persists across check() calls)
- src/linters/dry/typescript_analyzer.py (TypeScript tokenization stub)

**NOTE**: NO duplicate_detector.py - cache.py IS the hash table with query methods

**Key Algorithm (Single-Pass Streaming)**:
1. DRYRule is stateful - cache initialized once, persists across ALL check() calls
2. For each file:
   - Check if fresh in cache (mtime comparison)
   - If stale/new: analyze file, insert blocks into DB
   - Query DB for duplicates: `SELECT * FROM code_blocks WHERE hash_value = ?`
   - Build violations for THIS file only
3. SQLite cache IS the project-wide hash table (not just per-file cache)
4. Token-based rolling hash (Rabin-Karp)
5. Mtime-based cache invalidation

**SQLite Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE files (
    file_path TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    mtime REAL NOT NULL,
    hash_count INTEGER,
    last_scanned TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE code_blocks (
    file_path TEXT,
    hash_value INTEGER,
    start_line INTEGER,
    end_line INTEGER,
    snippet TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (file_path) REFERENCES files(file_path)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_hash ON code_blocks(hash_value);
```

**Key Cache Methods**:
- `find_duplicates_by_hash(hash_value)` - Query ALL blocks with this hash (PRIMARY method)
- `get_blocks_for_file(file_path)` - Get blocks for specific file
- `add_blocks(file_path, mtime, blocks)` - Insert new blocks into DB
- `is_fresh(file_path, mtime)` - Check if file needs re-analysis

**Completion Criteria**:
- ✅ 64-80 tests passing (~80% of 106 tests from PR1)
- ✅ Python duplicate detection working
- ✅ SQLite cache working with query methods (find_duplicates_by_hash)
- ✅ Cross-file detection working (DB queries across all files)
- ✅ Stateful DRYRule maintains cache across check() calls
- ✅ TypeScript stubbed (returns no violations)
- ✅ Config loading with cache settings working
- ✅ Violation messages show all duplicate locations
- ✅ Performance: <5s for 1K files (first run), <1s (cached)

## PR4: Dogfooding Discovery 🔴 NOT STARTED

**Objective**: Find ALL DRY violations in thai-lint codebase

**Activities**:
1. Run `make lint-dry` on thai-lint codebase
2. Catalog violations in `.roadmap/in-progress/dry-linter/VIOLATIONS.md`
3. Analyze patterns (test setup, CLI helpers, config loading)
4. Configure `.thailint.yaml` with appropriate thresholds
5. Document refactoring strategy for PR5
6. Measure cache performance on real project

**Expected Findings**:
- 15-30 violations (based on nesting: 18, SRP: 6 patterns)
- Common patterns: test fixtures, CLI helper duplication
- Prioritize: src/ violations first, tests/ second

**Completion Criteria**:

1. **Extract Shared Fixture**: Test setup duplication → conftest.py
2. **Extract Helper Function**: Repeated CLI logic → cli_helpers.py
3. **Extract Utility Class**: Common patterns → utility modules
4. **Template Method**: Similar algorithms → base class

**Process**:
1. Fix violations one-by-one (commit per fix)
2. Run tests after each fix: `make test`
3. Verify violation count decreases: `make lint-dry`
4. Update VIOLATIONS.md with ✅ status
5. Document refactoring decisions

**Completion Criteria**:
- ✅ Zero violations: `thailint dry src/` exits code 0
- ✅ All tests passing: 317+ tests (80-100 new from PR1)
- ✅ Pylint 10.00/10
- ✅ Xenon A-grade (all functions)

## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

### **Core Architecture**

**Two-Tier Storage**:
1. **In-Memory Hash Table**: Working set for current scan (fast lookups)
2. **SQLite Cache**: Persistent storage with mtime-based invalidation

**Single-Pass Algorithm**:
```
For each file:
  1. Check cache: Is file unchanged? (compare mtime)
     YES → Load hashes from SQLite into memory
     NO  → Hash file + save to cache
  2. Look up duplicates in memory for THIS file only
  3. Report violations for THIS file
```

**Token-Based Hashing (Rabin-Karp)**:
1. Tokenize code (strip comments, normalize whitespace)
2. Create rolling hash windows (size = min_duplicate_lines)
3. Hash each window: hash(line1 + line2 + line3)
4. Store: hash_table[hash] = [(file, start_line, end_line, code)]
5. Find duplicates: len(hash_table[hash]) >= 2

### **Performance Optimization**

**Cache Benefits**:
- First run (10K files): ~8 minutes (hash + cache write)
- Second run (no changes): ~10 seconds (cache read only)
- Typical commit (50 files): ~15 seconds (50 rehashed, 9950 cached)
- **10-50x speedup** for incremental scans

**Memory Management**:
- Hash table: dict[int, list[CodeBlock]]
- CodeBlock: ~200 bytes each
- 10K files × 500 blocks = ~1GB worst case (typically <500MB)

## 📝 Notes for AI Agents

### Critical Context

**Multi-File Context Challenge**:
- Existing linters (nesting, SRP) analyze files independently
- DRY needs ALL files to find cross-project duplicates
- Solution: Single-pass with file buffering in hash table

**SQLite No External Dependencies**:
- SQLite ships with Python stdlib (import sqlite3)
- No installation, configuration, or Docker needed
- Just a file: `.thailint-cache/dry.db`

**Cache Invalidation**:
- Use file mtime (modification time) to detect changes
- If mtime matches cache: load from SQLite
- If mtime differs: rehash and update cache

**Performance Critical**:
- This linter MUST scale to 10K+ files
- Caching is essential, not optional
- Target: 10-50x speedup for incremental scans

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. ❌ **Don't buffer file contents**: Only store hashes and metadata
2. ❌ **Don't forget mtime invalidation**: Stale cache = wrong results
3. ❌ **Don't report all violations on first file**: Report per-file only
4. ❌ **Don't include in lint-full**: Too slow for fast iteration
5. ❌ **Don't use AST parsing for hashing**: Token-based is simpler and faster
6. ❌ **Don't forget cache corruption recovery**: Graceful fallback to rehashing
7. ❌ **Don't ignore cache performance**: Test with 1K+ file projects
