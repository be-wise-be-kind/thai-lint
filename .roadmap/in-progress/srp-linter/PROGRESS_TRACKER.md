## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Test-First Development (PR1-PR2)
Write complete test suite before any implementation, then implement to pass tests. This ensures comprehensive coverage and clear requirements.

### Phase 2: Integration (PR3)
Connect SRP linter to all deployment modes (CLI, Library, Docker) following the pattern established by file_placement and nesting linters.

### Phase 3: Dogfooding & Quality (PR4-PR6)
Use the linter on itself to find real-world issues, fix them systematically, and document best practices learned during refactoring.

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- ⬜ Test coverage >85% on SRP linter modules
- ⬜ All 60-80 tests pass
- ⬜ Both Python and TypeScript support working
- ⬜ Performance: <100ms per file for analysis

### Feature Metrics
- ⬜ CLI mode: `thai-lint srp .` works
- ⬜ Library mode: `linter.lint(path, rules=['srp'])` works
- ⬜ Docker mode: `docker run thailint srp /workspace` works
- ⬜ Dogfooded on thai-lint codebase (zero violations or all acknowledged)
- ⬜ Documentation complete with refactoring examples

### Code Quality Metrics
- ⬜ thai-lint codebase has zero SRP violations (or all explicitly ignored)
- ⬜ make lint-full exits with code 0
- ⬜ All integration tests pass
- ⬜ No functionality broken during refactoring

## 📝 Notes for AI Agents

### Critical Context
- **TDD is mandatory**: Write ALL tests first (PR1), then implement (PR2)
- **Default thresholds**: max_methods=7, max_loc=200 (configurable)
- **Multi-language support**: Both Python and TypeScript required from the start
- **Pattern to follow**: Study nesting linter structure (most similar pattern)
- **SRP is subjective**: Use heuristics (method count, LOC, keywords) not perfect detection

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Don't implement before tests exist (PR1 must have zero implementation)
- ❌ Don't skip TypeScript support (both languages required)
- ❌ Don't forget to update PROGRESS_TRACKER.md after each PR
- ❌ Don't merge PRs with failing tests
- ❌ Don't skip dogfooding (PRs 4-6 are critical for quality)
- ❌ Don't ignore SRP violations without justification comments
- ❌ Don't use perfect SRP detection (use practical heuristics)

### Resources
- **Pattern Example**: src/linters/nesting/linter.py (most similar)
- **Base Interfaces**: src/core/base.py (BaseLintRule, BaseLintContext)
- **Test Patterns**: tests/unit/linters/nesting/ (existing test structure)
- **Config Pattern**: src/linters/nesting/config.py (configuration dataclass)

### SRP Detection Heuristics

**Python** (class-level analysis):
- Method count > threshold (default: 7)
- Lines of code > threshold (default: 200)
- Responsibility keywords in class name ("Manager", "Handler", "Processor", "Utility", "Helper")
- High coupling (many imports, dependencies)
- Low cohesion (methods don't share fields/behavior)

**TypeScript** (class-level analysis):
- Same heuristics as Python
- Additional: interface method count
- Constructor parameter count (dependency injection smell)
