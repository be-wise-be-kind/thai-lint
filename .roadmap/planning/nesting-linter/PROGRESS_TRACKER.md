## PR3.5: TypeScript Analyzer Implementation 🟢 COMPLETE

**Objective**: Complete TypeScript AST analysis to pass remaining TypeScript tests

**Background**: PR2 intentionally stubbed TypeScript analyzer to focus on Python implementation first. This PR implements full TypeScript support using tree-sitter (pure Python).

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Research typescript-estree parser integration options → Used tree-sitter instead (pure Python)
2. ✅ Add tree-sitter and tree-sitter-typescript dependencies to pyproject.toml
3. ✅ Implement parse_typescript() using tree-sitter Python bindings
4. ✅ Map tree-sitter node types to nesting statements (if_statement, for_statement, etc.)
5. ✅ Implement depth calculation for TypeScript AST nodes with tree-sitter visitor pattern
6. ✅ Implement find_all_functions() for TypeScript (function_declaration, arrow_function, method_definition)
7. ✅ Update linter.py to call TypeScript analyzer with proper type hints
8. ✅ Fix ignore directive edge cases (TypeScript comment syntax, block ignore, prefix matching)
9. ✅ Run TypeScript tests: all 15 tests pass (100%)
10. ✅ Verify arrow functions and async functions work correctly
11. ✅ Update this document

**Completion Criteria**:
- ✅ 76/76 tests pass (100% - all tests passing!)
- ✅ All 15 TypeScript tests pass (100%)
- ✅ TypeScript files analyzed correctly via CLI and API
- ✅ Test coverage: 87% on TypeScript analyzer, 92% on linter
- ✅ Pure Python solution (no Node.js dependency needed!)

**Files Modified**:
- pyproject.toml (added tree-sitter, tree-sitter-typescript dependencies)
- src/linters/nesting/typescript_analyzer.py (full tree-sitter implementation)
- src/linters/nesting/linter.py (added TypeScript integration and type hints)
- src/linter_config/ignore.py (fixed rule matching, added block ignore, TypeScript comment support)

**Implementation Approach: tree-sitter (Pure Python)**
✅ Pure Python solution - no Node.js required
✅ Pre-compiled binaries for fast installation
✅ Robust parsing for 40+ languages
✅ Used by GitHub, Neovim, and other major projects
✅ Supports TypeScript, TSX, and JavaScript

**Key Improvements**:
- Implemented block ignore support (# thailint: ignore-start / ignore-end)
- Fixed TypeScript comment syntax support (// thailint: ignore)
- Improved rule matching to support prefix patterns (e.g., "nesting" matches "nesting.excessive-depth")
- Full TypeScript AST analysis with function detection and depth calculation

**Test Results**: 76/76 passing (100%)

## PR5: Dogfooding Fixes (Batch 1) 🔴 NOT STARTED

**Objective**: Fix first batch of nesting violations via refactoring

**Steps**:
1. ⬜ Read PR_BREAKDOWN.md → PR5 section
2. ⬜ Review VIOLATIONS.md → Easy + Medium categories
3. ⬜ Fix ~50% of violations via:
   - Early returns / guard clauses
   - Extracting nested logic to helper functions
   - Combining conditions where appropriate
   - Using functional approaches (map/filter/reduce)
4. ⬜ Run tests after each refactor: `make test`
5. ⬜ Verify no functionality broken
6. ⬜ Run nesting linter: violations reduced by ~50%
7. ⬜ Update this document

**Completion Criteria**:
- ⬜ ~50% of violations fixed
- ⬜ All tests still pass (make test exits with code 0)
- ⬜ make lint-full still passes
- ⬜ No functionality broken (integration tests pass)
- ⬜ Updated VIOLATIONS.md with remaining issues

**Refactoring Patterns**:

## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Test-First Development (PR1-PR2)
Write complete test suite before any implementation, then implement to pass tests. This ensures comprehensive coverage and clear requirements.

### Phase 2: Integration (PR3)
Connect nesting linter to all deployment modes (CLI, Library, Docker) following the pattern established by file_placement linter.

### Phase 3: Dogfooding & Quality (PR4-PR6)
Use the linter on itself to find real-world issues, fix them systematically, and document best practices learned during refactoring.

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- ✅ Test coverage >85% on nesting linter modules
- ✅ All 68 tests pass
- ✅ Both Python and TypeScript support working
- ✅ Performance: <100ms per file for AST parsing and analysis

### Feature Metrics
- ✅ CLI mode: `thai lint nesting .` works
- ✅ Library mode: `linter.lint(path, rules=['nesting'])` works
- ✅ Docker mode: `docker run thailint lint nesting /workspace` works
- ✅ Dogfooded on thai-lint codebase (zero violations or all acknowledged)
- ✅ Documentation complete with refactoring examples

### Code Quality Metrics
- ✅ thai-lint codebase has zero nesting violations (or all explicitly ignored)
- ✅ make lint-full exits with code 0
- ✅ All integration tests pass
- ✅ No functionality broken during refactoring

## 📝 Notes for AI Agents

### Critical Context
- **Reference implementation**: /home/stevejackson/Projects/durable-code-test/tools/design_linters/rules/style/nesting_rules.py
- **TDD is mandatory**: Write ALL tests first (PR1), then implement (PR2)
- **Default max_nesting_depth**: 4 (matching reference implementation)
- **Depth counting starts at 1**: Function body is depth 1, first nested block is depth 2
- **Multi-language support**: Both Python and TypeScript required from the start
- **Pattern to follow**: Study file_placement linter structure

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Don't implement before tests exist (PR1 must have zero implementation)
- ❌ Don't skip TypeScript support (both languages required)
- ❌ Don't forget to update PROGRESS_TRACKER.md after each PR
- ❌ Don't merge PRs with failing tests
- ❌ Don't skip dogfooding (PRs 4-6 are critical for quality)
- ❌ Don't ignore violations without justification comments

### Resources
- **Reference Implementation**: /home/stevejackson/Projects/durable-code-test/tools/design_linters/rules/style/nesting_rules.py
- **Pattern Example**: src/linters/file_placement/linter.py
- **Base Interfaces**: src/core/base.py (BaseLintRule, BaseLintContext)
- **Test Patterns**: tests/unit/linters/file_placement/ (existing test structure)

### AST Node Types to Track

**Python** (increases nesting depth):
- ast.If
- ast.For
- ast.While
- ast.With
- ast.AsyncWith
- ast.Try
- ast.ExceptHandler
- ast.Match
- ast.match_case

**TypeScript** (increases nesting depth):
- IfStatement
- ForStatement
- ForInStatement
- ForOfStatement
- WhileStatement
- DoWhileStatement
- TryStatement
- CatchClause
- SwitchStatement
- WithStatement (deprecated but still exists)
