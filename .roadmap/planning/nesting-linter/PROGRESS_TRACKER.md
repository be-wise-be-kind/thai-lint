**Objective**: Fix first batch of nesting violations via refactoring

**Steps**:
1. ⬜ Read PR_BREAKDOWN.md → PR5 section
2. ⬜ Review VIOLATIONS.md → Easy + Medium categories

5. ⬜ Verify no functionality broken
6. ⬜ Run nesting linter: violations reduced by ~50%
7. ⬜ Update this document

**Completion Criteria**:
- ⬜ ~50% of violations fixed
- ⬜ All tests still pass (make test exits with code 0)
- ⬜ make lint-full still passes
- ⬜ No functionality broken (integration tests pass)
- ⬜ Updated VIOLATIONS.md with remaining issues

**Refactoring Patterns**:
- Early returns to reduce nesting

## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Test-First Development (PR1-PR2)
Write complete test suite before any implementation, then implement to pass tests. This ensures comprehensive coverage and clear requirements.

### Phase 2: Integration (PR3)
Connect nesting linter to all deployment modes (CLI, Library, Docker) following the pattern established by file_placement linter.

### Phase 3: Dogfooding & Quality (PR4-PR6)
Use the linter on itself to find real-world issues, fix them systematically, and document best practices learned during refactoring.

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- ✅ Test coverage >85% on nesting linter modules
- ✅ All 68 tests pass
- ✅ Both Python and TypeScript support working
- ✅ Performance: <100ms per file for AST parsing and analysis

### Feature Metrics
- ✅ CLI mode: `thai lint nesting .` works
- ✅ Library mode: `linter.lint(path, rules=['nesting'])` works
- ✅ Docker mode: `docker run thailint lint nesting /workspace` works
- ✅ Dogfooded on thai-lint codebase (zero violations or all acknowledged)
- ✅ Documentation complete with refactoring examples

### Code Quality Metrics
- ✅ thai-lint codebase has zero nesting violations (or all explicitly ignored)
- ✅ make lint-full exits with code 0
- ✅ All integration tests pass
- ✅ No functionality broken during refactoring

## 📝 Notes for AI Agents

### Critical Context
- **Reference implementation**: /home/stevejackson/Projects/durable-code-test/tools/design_linters/rules/style/nesting_rules.py
- **TDD is mandatory**: Write ALL tests first (PR1), then implement (PR2)
- **Default max_nesting_depth**: 4 (matching reference implementation)
- **Depth counting starts at 1**: Function body is depth 1, first nested block is depth 2
- **Multi-language support**: Both Python and TypeScript required from the start
- **Pattern to follow**: Study file_placement linter structure

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Don't implement before tests exist (PR1 must have zero implementation)
- ❌ Don't skip TypeScript support (both languages required)
- ❌ Don't forget to update PROGRESS_TRACKER.md after each PR
- ❌ Don't merge PRs with failing tests
- ❌ Don't skip dogfooding (PRs 4-6 are critical for quality)
- ❌ Don't ignore violations without justification comments

### Resources
- **Reference Implementation**: /home/stevejackson/Projects/durable-code-test/tools/design_linters/rules/style/nesting_rules.py
- **Pattern Example**: src/linters/file_placement/linter.py
- **Base Interfaces**: src/core/base.py (BaseLintRule, BaseLintContext)
- **Test Patterns**: tests/unit/linters/file_placement/ (existing test structure)

### AST Node Types to Track

**Python** (increases nesting depth):
- ast.If
- ast.For
- ast.While
- ast.With
- ast.AsyncWith
- ast.Try
- ast.ExceptHandler
- ast.Match
- ast.match_case

**TypeScript** (increases nesting depth):
- IfStatement
- ForStatement
- ForInStatement
- ForOfStatement
- WhileStatement
- DoWhileStatement
- TryStatement
- CatchClause
- SwitchStatement
- WithStatement (deprecated but still exists)
