# Stateless Class Linter - Progress Tracker & AI Agent Handoff Document

**Purpose**: Primary AI agent handoff document for Stateless Class Linter with TDD-driven implementation tracking

**Scope**: Python linter that detects classes without constructors and instance state that should be refactored to module-level functions

**Overview**: Primary handoff document for AI agents working on the Stateless Class Linter feature.
    Tracks current implementation progress using Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. Each PR starts with
    writing comprehensive tests that define expected behavior, then implements the minimum code to make tests pass.
    Contains current status, TDD workflow guidance, PR dashboard, and success metrics. Essential for maintaining
    development continuity and ensuring systematic, test-first feature implementation.

**Dependencies**: AST analysis, existing linter framework patterns (DRY linter, SRP linter), pytest

**Exports**: Progress tracking, TDD implementation guidance, AI agent coordination, and feature development roadmap

**Related**: AI_CONTEXT.md for feature overview, PR_BREAKDOWN.md for detailed TDD tasks

**Implementation**: Test-Driven Development with Red-Green-Refactor cycle for each PR

## PR1: Core Detection Logic (TDD)

**TDD Goal**: Define stateless class behavior through tests, then implement detector

### RED Phase: Write Failing Tests

**Test Cases to Write FIRST**:
- [ ] Test: Detect class with 2+ methods, no __init__, no instance attrs → VIOLATION
- [ ] Test: Detect class with __init__ but empty → NO VIOLATION (has constructor)
- [ ] Test: Detect class with instance attributes → NO VIOLATION (has state)
- [ ] Test: Detect ABC class → NO VIOLATION (legitimate pattern)
- [ ] Test: Detect Protocol class → NO VIOLATION (legitimate pattern)
- [ ] Test: Detect class with decorators → NO VIOLATION (framework usage)
- [ ] Test: Detect class with class-level attributes → NO VIOLATION (has state)
- [ ] Test: Detect class with __new__ → NO VIOLATION (custom constructor)
- [ ] Test: Detect empty class → NO VIOLATION (placeholder)
- [ ] Test: Detect class with single method → NO VIOLATION (too few methods)
- [ ] Test: Real-world case - TokenHasher → VIOLATION

**Success Criteria for RED Phase**:
- ✅ All tests written and fail with "NotImplementedError" or "ImportError"
- ✅ Tests are clear, readable, and well-documented
- ✅ Test coverage plan reaches >90%

### GREEN Phase: Implement Detector

**Implementation Steps** (only after tests are written):
- [ ] Create `src/linters/stateless_class/` directory
- [ ] Implement minimal AST visitor to make first test pass
- [ ] Incrementally add logic to make each test pass
- [ ] Stop when all tests pass (don't over-engineer)

**Success Criteria for GREEN Phase**:
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ No additional features beyond what tests require
- ✅ Code is minimal and focused

### REFACTOR Phase: Improve Code Quality

**Refactoring Goals**:
- [ ] Extract repeated logic into helper methods
- [ ] Improve variable/method names for clarity
- [ ] Add type hints
- [ ] Add docstrings (Google style)
- [ ] Ensure Pylint score 10.00/10
- [ ] Ensure all complexity checks pass (A-grade)

**Success Criteria for REFACTOR Phase**:
- ✅ All tests still pass
- ✅ Code is clean, readable, and well-documented
- ✅ No quality violations
- ✅ Performance is acceptable

**Files to Create**:
- `tests/test_linters/test_stateless_class/test_detector.py` (RED phase)
- `src/linters/stateless_class/__init__.py` (GREEN phase)
- `src/linters/stateless_class/detector.py` (GREEN phase)
- `src/linters/stateless_class/violation.py` (GREEN phase)

## PR2: CLI Integration & Config (TDD)

**TDD Goal**: Write integration tests for CLI, then implement CLI commands

### RED Phase: Write Failing Integration Tests

**Test Cases to Write FIRST**:
- [ ] Test: `thai-lint stateless-class <file>` exits 0 when no violations
- [ ] Test: `thai-lint stateless-class <file>` exits 1 when violations found
- [ ] Test: `thai-lint stateless-class <file>` outputs violation details
- [ ] Test: Configuration loaded from .thai-lint.yml
- [ ] Test: Can enable/disable linter via config
- [ ] Test: Integration with lint-all command

### GREEN Phase: Implement CLI Integration

**Implementation Steps** (only after tests are written):
- [ ] Add stateless-class command to CLI
- [ ] Wire up detector to CLI framework
- [ ] Add configuration support
- [ ] Make all integration tests pass

### REFACTOR Phase: Polish CLI

**Refactoring Goals**:
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] Add helpful suggestions in output
- [ ] Clean up CLI code structure

---

## PR3: Documentation & Self-Dogfood

**Goal**: Document the linter and run it on our own codebase

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Write user-facing documentation
- [ ] Create before/after examples
- [ ] Run stateless-class linter on thai-lint codebase
- [ ] Fix any violations found in our code (or justify suppressions)
- [ ] Update README with new linter
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Documentation is clear with examples
- ✅ Our own codebase passes the linter (dogfooding)
- ✅ README updated

## 🚀 TDD Implementation Strategy

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

```
RED: Write a failing test
  ↓
GREEN: Write minimal code to pass the test
  ↓
REFACTOR: Improve code while keeping tests passing
  ↓
Repeat for next feature
```

### TDD Best Practices

1. **Write the simplest test first** - Start with happy path
2. **One test at a time** - Don't write all tests at once
3. **Minimal implementation** - Only write code to pass the current test
4. **Refactor with confidence** - Tests provide safety net
5. **Test behavior, not implementation** - Focus on what, not how

### Test Organization

```python
# tests/test_linters/test_stateless_class/test_detector.py

class TestStatelessClassDetection:
    """Test cases for detecting stateless classes."""

    def test_detects_class_without_init(self):
        """Should flag class with methods but no __init__."""
        # RED: This test fails first
        # GREEN: Implement detector to make it pass
        # REFACTOR: Clean up without breaking test

    def test_ignores_class_with_init(self):
        """Should not flag class with __init__."""
        # Another RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
```

## 📝 Notes for AI Agents

### Critical TDD Context
- **Tests define the spec**: Tests document what the linter should do
- **Write tests FIRST**: No implementation before tests exist
- **Minimal implementation**: Only write code to pass tests, no more
- **Refactor fearlessly**: Tests provide safety net for improvements

### TDD Workflow for AI Agents

When implementing a PR:
1. **Start in tests/** - Write test file first
2. **Run tests** - Verify they fail (RED)
3. **Go to src/** - Implement minimum code to pass
4. **Run tests** - Verify they pass (GREEN)
5. **Improve code** - Refactor while tests still pass
6. **Run lint** - Ensure quality standards met

### Common TDD Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Writing code first** - Always write test before implementation
2. **Over-engineering** - Only implement what tests require
3. **Skipping refactor** - Always clean up after tests pass
4. **Testing implementation** - Test behavior, not internal details
5. **Not running tests** - Verify RED and GREEN phases

### Resources
- TDD methodology: Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Existing test patterns: tests/test_linters/test_dry/, tests/test_linters/test_srp/
- Python AST docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html
- TypeScript precedent: https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-extraneous-class/
