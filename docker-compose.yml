# Purpose: Docker Compose configuration for development and testing of thai-lint CLI
# Scope: Development environment orchestration with CLI service and volume mounting
# Overview: Defines Docker Compose services for local development and testing of thai-lint.
#     Provides a CLI service that builds from local Dockerfile, mounts the current workspace
#     for easy testing, and configures proper user permissions to avoid file ownership issues.
#     Supports both development workflows (build and run locally) and production simulation
#     (pull from registry). Includes health checks, restart policies, and environment variable
#     configuration for comprehensive development support.
# Dependencies: Docker, Docker Compose, local Dockerfile
# Exports: Docker Compose services for CLI execution and development testing
# Interfaces: Volume mounts at /workspace, CLI service for command execution
# Environment: Local development, CI/CD testing, production simulation
# Related: Dockerfile, .dockerignore, pyproject.toml
# Implementation: Single service configuration with volume mounting, user mapping, and
#     development-friendly settings for rapid iteration
