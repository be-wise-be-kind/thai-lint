## Overview

This guide covers the complete release process for publishing thailint to PyPI. The process is semi-automated using GitHub Actions with manual quality gates.

## Release Types

Following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** (x.0.0): Breaking changes, incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** (1.x.0): New features, backwards compatible
- **PATCH** (1.0.x): Bug fixes, backwards compatible

## Pre-Release Checklist

Before starting a release, ensure all quality gates pass:

### 1. Code Quality

```bash
# Run full linting suite (must exit with code 0)
just lint-full
echo $?  # Should output: 0

# Run fast linting
just lint
echo $?  # Should output: 0

# Run type checking
poetry run mypy src/
echo $?  # Should output: 0
```

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] `just lint-full` exits with code 0 (no Pylint violations)
- [ ] `just lint` exits with code 0 (no Ruff errors)
- [ ] `mypy src/` exits with code 0 (no type errors)
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities (`just lint-security`)
- [ ] Complexity metrics meet standards (`just lint-complexity`)

### 2. Test Suite

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
just test-coverage

# Check coverage threshold (80% minimum)
poetry run coverage report --fail-under=80
```

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] All tests pass (pytest exit code 0)
- [ ] Test coverage â‰¥80% overall
- [ ] Core modules â‰¥90% coverage
- [ ] No failing integration tests
- [ ] Docker tests pass (if applicable)

### 3. Documentation

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with all changes for this version
- [ ] README.md reflects current features and usage
- [ ] All docstrings complete and accurate
- [ ] API examples tested and working
- [ ] Breaking changes documented in CHANGELOG
- [ ] Migration guide provided (if breaking changes)

### 4. Local Build Verification

```bash
# Clean previous builds
rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info

# Build package
poetry build

# Verify build artifacts
ls -lh dist/
# Should show: thailint-X.Y.Z.tar.gz and thailint-X.Y.Z-py3-none-any.whl

# Check package contents
tar -tzf dist/thailint-*.tar.gz | head -30
unzip -l dist/thailint-*.whl | head -30
```

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] Build succeeds without errors
- [ ] Both `.tar.gz` and `.whl` files created
- [ ] Package includes necessary files (src/, README, LICENSE, CHANGELOG)
- [ ] Package excludes development files (tests/, .github/, .ai/)
- [ ] Package size reasonable (<5MB for source, <2MB for wheel)

### 5. Install Test in Clean Environment

```bash
# Create clean virtual environment
python -m venv /tmp/test-thailint-env
source /tmp/test-thailint-env/bin/activate

# Install from local build
pip install dist/thailint-*.whl

# Test CLI works
thailint --help
thailint --version

# Test library import
python -c "from thailint import Linter; print('Library import works')"

# Test file-placement linter
thailint lint file-placement --help

# Deactivate and cleanup
deactivate
rm -rf /tmp/test-thailint-env
```

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] Package installs without errors
- [ ] CLI command `thailint` available in PATH
- [ ] `thailint --help` displays help text
- [ ] `thailint --version` shows correct version
- [ ] Library import `from thailint import Linter` works
- [ ] All three modes functional (CLI, Library, Docker)
- [ ] Entry points configured correctly

### 6. Docker Verification

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t thailint/thailint:test .

# Test CLI in container
docker run --rm thailint/thailint:test --help
docker run --rm thailint/thailint:test --version

# Test with volume mount
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace thailint/thailint:test lint file-placement /workspace
```

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] Docker image builds successfully
- [ ] Image size reasonable (â‰¤300MB)
- [ ] CLI works in container
- [ ] Volume mounting works correctly
- [ ] Non-root user execution verified

## Version Bumping

### 1. Choose Version Number

Determine version using semantic versioning:

```bash
# Current version
grep '^version = ' pyproject.toml

# Examples:
# 1.0.0 â†’ 1.0.1 (patch: bug fixes)
# 1.0.0 â†’ 1.1.0 (minor: new features)
# 1.0.0 â†’ 2.0.0 (major: breaking changes)
```

### 2. Update Version in pyproject.toml

```bash
# Option 1: Manual edit
vim pyproject.toml
# Update line: version = "X.Y.Z"

# Option 2: Poetry version command
poetry version patch   # 1.0.0 â†’ 1.0.1
poetry version minor   # 1.0.0 â†’ 1.1.0
poetry version major   # 1.0.0 â†’ 2.0.0
```

### 3. Update CHANGELOG.md

```bash
# Edit CHANGELOG.md
vim CHANGELOG.md
```

1. Move `[Unreleased]` changes to new `[X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section
2. Add release date
3. Ensure all changes categorized correctly (Added, Changed, Fixed, etc.)
4. Add any missing changes
5. Create new empty `[Unreleased]` section

### 4. Commit Version Bump

```bash
# Stage version changes
git add pyproject.toml CHANGELOG.md

# Commit with conventional commit message
git commit -m "chore(release): Bump version to X.Y.Z

- Update version in pyproject.toml
- Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes

### 5. Create and Push Tag

```bash
# Create annotated tag
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release version X.Y.Z"

# Push commit and tag
git push origin main
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

**Important:** Pushing the tag triggers the GitHub Actions workflow!

## Automated Publishing Workflow

Once the tag is pushed, GitHub Actions automatically:

1. **Runs Tests** (`test` job)
   - Installs dependencies
   - Runs linting (`just lint`)
   - Runs type checking (`mypy`)
   - Runs test suite with coverage
   - Verifies â‰¥80% coverage

2. **Builds Package** (`build` job)
   - Runs after tests pass
   - Builds with `poetry build`
   - Verifies package contents
   - Uploads artifacts

3. **Publishes to PyPI** (`publish-pypi` job)
   - Runs after build succeeds
   - Uses PyPI Trusted Publishing (OIDC)
   - No API tokens needed
   - Publishes both `.tar.gz` and `.whl`

4. **Creates GitHub Release** (`create-release` job)
   - Extracts changelog for version
   - Creates GitHub release
   - Attaches build artifacts
   - Links to PyPI package

### Monitor Workflow

```bash
# Watch workflow progress
gh run watch

# Or visit GitHub Actions UI:
# https://github.com/steve-e-jackson/thai-lint/actions
```

### Workflow Failure Handling

If any job fails:

1. **Test Failures**: Fix issues, commit, push to main, re-tag
2. **Build Failures**: Check build configuration, re-tag after fixes
3. **PyPI Publishing Failures**:
   - Check PyPI Trusted Publishing configuration
   - Verify package name not already taken for this version
   - Check PyPI status page
4. **Release Creation Failures**: Manually create release if needed

## PyPI Trusted Publishing Setup

**One-time setup** required before first release:

### 1. Create PyPI Account

1. Go to https://pypi.org/account/register/
2. Create account and verify email
3. Enable 2FA (required for trusted publishing)

### 2. Configure Trusted Publishing

1. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
2. Click "Add a new pending publisher"
3. Fill in:
   - **PyPI Project Name**: `thailint`
   - **Owner**: `steve-e-jackson`
   - **Repository name**: `thai-lint`
   - **Workflow name**: `publish-pypi.yml`
   - **Environment name**: `pypi`
4. Click "Add"

### 3. First Release Requires Manual Intervention

For the **first release only**, PyPI may require manual approval:

1. Workflow will fail at publish step
2. Log into PyPI
3. Approve pending publisher
4. Re-run workflow or re-tag

Subsequent releases are automatic.

## Post-Release Verification

After workflow completes successfully:

### 1. Verify PyPI Publication

```bash
# Check package on PyPI
open https://pypi.org/project/thailint/X.Y.Z/

# Install from PyPI in clean environment
python -m venv /tmp/verify-pypi
source /tmp/verify-pypi/bin/activate
pip install thailint==X.Y.Z

# Test installation
thailint --version
thailint --help

# Cleanup
deactivate
rm -rf /tmp/verify-pypi
```

**Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] Package visible on PyPI
- [ ] Correct version number displayed
- [ ] README renders correctly on PyPI
- [ ] Installation from PyPI succeeds
- [ ] CLI works after PyPI install
- [ ] Library import works after PyPI install

### 2. Verify GitHub Release

```bash
# Check GitHub release
open https://github.com/steve-e-jackson/thai-lint/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z
```

**Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] Release created with correct version
- [ ] Changelog content extracted correctly
- [ ] Build artifacts attached (`.tar.gz` and `.whl`)
- [ ] Links to PyPI work
- [ ] Release not marked as draft/prerelease

### 3. Test Installation Methods

```bash
# Test pip install
pip install thailint

# Test Poetry install
poetry add thailint

# Test Docker pull (if published)
docker pull thailint/thailint:X.Y.Z
```

### 4. Update Documentation

- [ ] Update README badges (if version-specific)
- [ ] Update documentation site (if applicable)
- [ ] Post announcement (GitHub discussions, Twitter, etc.)

## Rollback Procedures

If critical issues are discovered after release:

### Option 1: Yank Release (Recommended)

```bash
# Yank release from PyPI (keeps metadata, prevents new installs)
pip install twine
twine upload --repository pypi --skip-existing dist/*
# Then manually yank on PyPI web interface
```

### Option 2: Publish Hotfix

```bash
# Immediately publish patch version with fix
# Example: 1.0.0 â†’ 1.0.1

# 1. Fix issue
# 2. Bump version to X.Y.Z+1
# 3. Update CHANGELOG
# 4. Tag and push
```

### Option 3: Delete GitHub Release

```bash
# Delete GitHub release (doesn't affect PyPI)
gh release delete vX.Y.Z --yes

# Delete tag
git push --delete origin vX.Y.Z
git tag -d vX.Y.Z
```

**Important:** You cannot re-upload the same version to PyPI. If yanked, must publish new version.

## Common Issues

### Issue: PyPI Trusted Publishing Not Working

**Solutions:**
1. Verify environment name matches (`pypi`)
2. Check repository name spelling
3. Ensure 2FA enabled on PyPI account
4. Re-configure trusted publisher on PyPI

### Issue: Version Already Exists on PyPI

**Solutions:**
1. Cannot overwrite existing PyPI versions
2. Bump to next patch version
3. Update tag and re-push

### Issue: Tests Fail in CI but Pass Locally

**Solutions:**
1. Check Python version matches (3.11)
2. Verify all dependencies in pyproject.toml
3. Check for environment-specific issues
4. Review CI logs for specific failures

### Issue: Package Size Too Large

**Solutions:**
1. Review MANIFEST.in exclusions
2. Check for included test files
3. Verify .dockerignore patterns
4. Use `tar -tzf dist/*.tar.gz` to inspect
