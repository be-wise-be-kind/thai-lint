#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Purpose: Safe git workflow automation for quick collaboration without pre-commit hooks
# Scope: Git staging, committing, and pushing with comprehensive safety checks
# Overview: Streamlines the commit-push workflow for rapid iteration and collaboration by bypassing
#     pre-commit hooks and linting checks while maintaining critical safety guards. Detects sensitive
#     files (secrets, credentials, keys), validates branch naming conventions, prevents main branch
#     commits, and shows change previews before execution. Designed for WIP commits and quick sharing
#     while protecting against common security mistakes and data loss scenarios.
# Dependencies: git, bash 4.0+
# Exports: Exit codes (0=success, 1=user abort or error)
# Interfaces: Git CLI, user prompts (stdin/stdout), color-coded terminal output
# Environment: Git repository with remote origin configured
# Related: justfile (just share), .pre-commit-config.yaml, .git/hooks/
# Philosophy: Speed for collaboration, safety against accidents - trust but verify before commit
