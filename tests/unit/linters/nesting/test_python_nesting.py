"""
Purpose: Test suite for Python nesting depth analysis

Scope: Python AST-based nesting depth calculation and violation detection

Overview: Comprehensive tests for Python code nesting depth analysis covering simple nesting
    patterns (single if/for/while statements), complex multi-level nesting, various Python
    statement types (if, for, while, with, try, match), accurate depth calculation algorithms,
    and violation detection at configurable limits. Verifies depth counting starts at 1 for
    function body and correctly increments for nested blocks. Tests both passing scenarios
    (depth within configured limits) and violation scenarios (depth exceeds limits). Validates
    AST-based analysis approach matches reference implementation behavior.

Dependencies: pytest for testing framework, src.linters.nesting.linter for NestingDepthRule,
    pathlib for Path handling, src.core.types for Violation

Exports: TestSimplePythonNesting (4 tests), TestPythonStatementTypes (6 tests),
    TestPythonDepthCalculation (5 tests) - total 15 test cases

Interfaces: Tests NestingDepthRule.check(context) -> list[Violation] with Python code samples

Implementation: Uses inline Python code strings as test fixtures, creates mock contexts with
    file_path and file_content, verifies violation detection and depth calculation accuracy
