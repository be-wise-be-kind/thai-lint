"""
Purpose: Test package for stateless class linter tests

Scope: Unit tests for detecting stateless Python classes

Overview: Package initialization for stateless class linter test suite. Contains
    comprehensive tests for detecting Python classes without __init__ and instance
    state that should be refactored to module-level functions. Test-driven development
    approach defines expected behavior through tests before implementation.

Dependencies: pytest for testing framework

Exports: Test modules for stateless class detection

Interfaces: N/A (test package)

Implementation: TDD approach - tests written first to define expected behavior
