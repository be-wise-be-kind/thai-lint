Purpose: Test package for stringly-typed linter functionality

Scope: Unit tests for stringly-typed pattern detection in Python and TypeScript

Overview: Organizes comprehensive unit tests for the stringly-typed linter feature, covering
    Python and TypeScript string validation pattern detection, equality chain detection,
    configuration handling, ignore directives, and edge cases. Contains test modules for
    basic detection patterns, false positive filtering, configuration loading, and cross-file
    analysis. Follows TDD approach with tests written before implementation to ensure
    comprehensive coverage and proper design validation.

Dependencies: pytest framework, stringly-typed linter implementation, shared test fixtures

Exports: Test modules for stringly-typed linter validation

Interfaces: pytest test discovery and execution

Implementation: Test package organization with shared fixtures in conftest.py
